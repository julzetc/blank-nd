Neocities readme file.

I am building a neocities website using VScode, and Neocities CLI to upload my code. I am doing it this way to learn web-development and Bitcoin development. This readme file will contain information about my work, and problems I had and how I overcame them.. The finished product can be seen at blank-nd.neocities.com.  

This repository uses a yml workflow to upload to github and neocities. This excludes the readme file
